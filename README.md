Having the extension installed will enable certain commands and an action button for React files, through which you can quickly, clearly and concisely obtain information about how your file is composed.

## Features

It will be able to tell you how many functional components are declared in the file, how many useState, useEffect, and how many lines of code you have.

You just have to press the heart icon

## Requirements
